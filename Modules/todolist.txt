TO DO LIST:

[MAIN PAGES] 

[X][2] review all pages and ensure we are happy with structure abd everything.
[comments: all looks good for now, still need to pretty up entropia maps page and add the slideshow functionality to ad panel ]

[X][1]-	Remove "hud-" from EU Applet tab butt textcontent if we can first
[comments: "hud-" has been removed from the textcontent in the tab buttons for the hud windows, it is still being used in id's as it should be ]

-------------------
-------------------
[X][2] find out why the susos doesnt behave the same on all pages and address it.
	edit: i have begun fixing all of the os on the home page, i may have to make some small changes to duplicate fixes on eu page
	    -  [X][2.5] - check to see if both pages seem to be the same at its current state, if not make it so. 
[comments: they currently seem to work the same, so far fully functional]

                                  [ SUS OS (JS-OS DEVELOPMENT) ]
								  





-------------------

[x][5]- fix the timer and text
[comments: ] 
[x][6]- more cool intuitive button for timer with some options
[comments: ]
--------------------

[o][7] make sure pages look good and are structured well. 
[comments: ]
[o][8] add individual tool pages - only important ones if necesary. 
[comments: ]

---------------------


-*- at this point we need to ensure we are ready to be able to add new os programs and updates individually easily as well as
having the js os load and unload them efficiently, debug them, and give user access to there code 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[o][9]
 review and figure out what ur doing for sure, adjust goals and todolist if needed
[comments: ]

[o][9.5] - add local storage size etc display functionality

[o][10] susos js os loads and unloads applets efficiently 
[comments: ]
[o][11] create a good default program that makes it easier to create various applets
[comments: ]
---------------------------------------------------
[o][12] - add the settings windows to susos
[comments: ]
[o][13] - add the ctrl panel windows to sus os 
[comments: ]
--------------------------------------------------

[o][14] add substance to power button

[o][15] -remove myeucodex

[o][16] - add a website disclaimer that entropia owns all its stuff and im not affiliated with anyone etc

[o][17] - add disclaimer to event planner about certain event areas having highr costs till we find solution

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 if this goes well we can now hopefully duplicate a blank or default program mould or window
  - default program shuld look like most other windows and used for duplication
 optional- consider buttons and inputs for options to adjust the window creation
  from here we would have to implement logic to handle adding the new programs if we want them automatically added directly
  a problem to solve later

 we can use place holder progs/applets for now maybe unless we have successfully built a program builder 
 
 
 
[o][18] - add the individual tool pages on eu page and placeholder pages on rsc page
[o][19] - add basic calculator,tools, widgets to unused big right panel on susos -
 also include the necessary profile/user info& access
 

 
[o][20] - fix style tuner so it matches the proper values etc and controls all the aesthetics
--------------------------------------------------------------
		[o][20-A]	- add a way to save/reset to default
 
		[o][20-A]	-current  -automatically stays however u set/leave it and be the one u load in with.
		[o][20-B]	-custom1 - a saved custom scheme
		[o][20-C]	custom2 - ""
		[o][20-D]	custom3	- ""
		[o][20-E]	-default1 - the default look
		[o][20-F]	-default2 - a secondary default look (we may add these in the future)
			
  then we will have a default they can use or also revert a custom one to. 
  copy save revert on current and
default schemes will require: copy save revert
custom schemes will require:  edit, rename, delete, revert

( REVERT will be used to revert to the last saved version of that scheme)
[o][21] - add cursor options to style tuner even if its a placeholder button for now that doesnt function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_________________________________________________________________________________
  
  [o][22] - update and improve the clock, 
          + add timers and stopwatch functions in the clock
  [o][23] - create a js os clock calender, and ability to set schedules, routines, todolists, reminders etc

 [o][24] - - see if theres a way we can send push notifications ^
             if so implement them to both calender, clock and necessary timers.
 
-fix maps tab in susos so they function or change them


 [o][25] - modifying old scripts and integrating new versions into susos :0 

EULOGSEARCH:
 -> *[o][26] -create/add eulogsearch*
------------------------------------------

TERMINAL:
 -> *[o][27] - modify and add a new version of terminal to sus os*
-------------------------------------------------
create and implement logic for :
 -> *[o][28] -shutdown/logoff/selfdestruct*
-------------------------------------------------
[o][29] -implement & integrate settings windows
 
[o][30] -implement notes 
[o][31] -implement simple text editor applet

 (we will save paint for later, we will use one of the nice little buttons in topright of susos and stick a pantbrush in it.
 then we can have a paint overlayer that lets u paint , overtop of whatever u were doing or also give u a background)


  -[ DESKTOP ][ALTERNATE]

   [o][32] - add tabs to sus os at the top

  
  - desktop is what contains all the programs, alternate is the current placeholder tab name text
  this new alternate tab will be on the right side of the desktop 
  clicking the tab will shrink the opposite so that the others contents is expanded -
  one click will highlight desktop, or halfsize it
  second will maximize it, third will minimize it, and it will cycle
 
 or double click to maximize and single click to highlight
 
 -we want to use the right side for games and stuff with an ar vibe potentially.
 first challenge will be to build a snake game that appears to not have a window or container

TO DO LIST:

[MAIN PAGES] 




----------
2) match the site stats boxes up -> MODULARIZE EVERYTHING





3    -.relocate both sus society link and akadia satvan button and page to appropriate spots inside eu tools page
     (may require moving files and editing image locations in code etc)

3.5  - create new buttons for entropia maps, sus society, satbav, tools etc on the eu tools page 
(seperate them from the main nav somehow)



4) fix eu maps page - (top panels and page structure)

4.5) review all pages and ensure we are happy with structure abd everything.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ SUS OS DEVELOPMENT ]

NUMERO UNO: find out why the susos doesnt behave the same on all pages and address it.

5-	REMOVE HUD- FROM EU APPLET NAMES if we can first

-------------------

6- fix stash manager and euitemstash
6.5-group stashmanager and euitemstash more intuitively - also in the folder

-------------------

7- fix the timer and text 
7.5- more cool intuitive button for timer with some options

--------------------

8- make sure pages look good and are structured well. 
9- add individual tool pages - only important ones if necesary. 


---------------------


-*- at this point we need to ensure we are ready to be able to add new os programs and updates individually easily as well as
having the js os load and unload them efficiently, debug them, and give user access to there code 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10-

 review and figure out what ur doing for sure, adjust goals and todolist if needed




11- susos js os loads and unloads applets efficiently 
12- create a good default program that makes it easier to create various applets
---------------------------------------------------
12.5-   - add the settings windows to susos
		- add the ctrl panel windows to sus os 
--------------------------------------------------

4- add substance to power button

5-remove myeucodex

6- add a website disclaimer that entropia owns all its stuff and im not affiliated with anyone etc

7- add disclaimer to event planner about certain event areas having highr costs till we find solution

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 if this goes well we can now hopefully duplicate a blank or default program mould or window
  - default program shuld look like most other windows and used for duplication
 optional- consider buttons and inputs for options to adjust the window creation
  from here we would have to implement logic to handle adding the new programs if we want them automatically added directly
  a problem to solve later

 we can use place holder progs/applets for now maybe unless we have successfully built a program builder 
 
 
 
13 - add the individual tool pages on eu page and placeholder pages on rsc page
14 - add basic calculator,tools, widgets to unused big right panel on susos -
 also include the necessary profile/user info& access
 

 
15 - fix style tuner so it matches the proper values etc and controls all the aesthetics
--------------------------------------------------------------
			- add a way to save/reset to default
 
			-current  -automatically stays however u set/leave it and be the one u load in with.
			-custom1 - a saved custom scheme
			custom2 - ""
			custom3	- ""
			-default1 - the default look
			-default2 - a secondary default look (we may add these in the future)
			
  then we will have a default they can use or also revert a custom one to. 
  copy save revert on current and
default schemes will require: copy save revert
custom schemes will require:  edit, rename, delete, revert

( REVERT will be used to revert to the last saved version of that scheme)
- add cursor options to style tuner even if its a placeholder button for now that doesnt function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_________________________________________________________________________________
  
  16 - update and improve the clock, 
          + add timers and stopwatch functions in the clock
  17 - create a js os clock calender, and ability to set schedules, routines, todolists, reminders etc

 17.5 - see if theres a way we can send push notifications ^
             if so implement them to both calender, clock and necessary timers.
 
-fix maps tab in susos so they function or change them


18) modifying old scripts and integrating new versions into susos :0 

EULOGSEARCH:
-create/add eulogsearch
------------------------------------------

TERMINAL:
*** modifier and add a new version of terminal to sus os 
-------------------------------------------------
create and implement logic for :
  ***  shutdown/logoff/selfdestruct
  
  -implement & integrate settings windows
 
 -implement notes 
 -implement simple text editor applet
 (we will save paint for later, we will use one of the nice little buttons in topright of susos and stick a pantbrush in it.
 then we can have a paint overlayer that lets u paint , overtop of whatever u were doing or also give u a background)


  -[ DESKTOP ][ALTERNATE]

   - add tabs to sus os at the top

  
  - desktop is what contains all the programs, alternate is the current placeholder tab name text
  this new alternate tab will be on the right side of the desktop 
  clicking the tab will shrink the opposite so that the others contents is expanded -
  one click will highlight desktop, or halfsize it
  second will maximize it, third will minimize it, and it will cycle
 
 or double click to maximize and single click to highlight
 
 -we want to use the right side for games and stuff with an ar vibe potentially.
 first challenge will be to build a snake game that appears to not have a window or container

*Berycled nest scene*

“When I found the nest, I counted thirteen eggs…I call that an aggressive brunch.”
[0:06]
(He keeps firing)
Jimbob (VO):
“I mean, yeah… I kinda felt bad.
But the squelching noise of exploding egg was oddly satisfying.”
[0:12]
(Quick montage of Berycled being shot/stabbed)
Jimbob (VO):
“Before I could even reload my Chon —
a handful of screechin’ drumsticks came charging.”

"ok but they were starting to swarm... "

"alright so the were pretty passive and just chilling but Alice told me to kill them all so i did"


🎬 Scene: Berycled Fight Chill Sequence + NPC Family Gag
(~35 sec visual, light beats, goofy moment)

NPC Brother:
"Mommy don’t make eye contact and maybe it won’t notice us..."

NPC Mom (calm, slightly distracted):
"That’s right, Sunny. Just keep watching those butterflies, honey."

(Butterfly drifts past. The brother stares blankly.)

🎙️ Scene: Jimbob VO Over Continued Fight → Fade to Camp Bar
(~25 seconds total voiceover)

[0:00] (VO begins during relaxed Bery fight montage)
Jimbob (VO):
“Y’know... it wasn’t a bad day. Got a few PED worth of ammo, some Nova fragments, and a handful of Acustim pills.
 That’ll keep the blaster hot for a little while.”

[0:08] (Starts fading to bar exterior/interior)
Jimbob (VO):
“But let’s be honest — if I ever wanna settle down, maybe get a shop out near the Howling Mines... I’m gonna need more than scraps and sweat.”

🍻 Scene: Camp Bar Interior — Dialogue (~20 sec)

Bartender:
"You look like you’ve been wrestlin’ Berycleds for sport. Ever think about takin’ a vacation?"

Jimbob:
"A vacation? Ha! I’m tryin’ to buy real estate, not cocktails. I can’t afford to sit still."

Suspicious Colonist Nearby (leans in):
"Then it’s your lucky cycle. I heard there’s work on Next Island... off the books, but maybe just what you’re lookin’ for."

🎬 [End Scene – Fade Out to Music / Next Time Tease]
Optional VO or onscreen text: “Next time… Jimbob goes off-world.”

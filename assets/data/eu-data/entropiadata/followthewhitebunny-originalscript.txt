🎬 SCRIPT: “Follow the White Bunny”
🟩 SCENE: JIMBOB’S APARTMENT – NIGHT
1. CLOSE-UP – Jimbob asleep, mouth open, light breathing. Faint computer hum in the background.

2. CUT TO – A slow pan over his desk:
 desk is full of ammo and clutter and a flickering monitor.

3. WIDE SHOT – Dim apartment.
 messy dim-lit apartment ( low gamma and brightness )

4. CLOSE-UP – COMPUTER SCREEN
--------------------------------------------
Green terminal-style text types slowly:

WAKE UP, JIMBOB...
[Beat]

THE GRIND HAS YOU.
JIMBOB – VO (half-asleep):
"What the..."

[Pause. Then new line types:]

"FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT."
----------------------------------------------
CUT TO – Jimbob Confused, still half asleep.
JIMBOB – VO (quieter, muttering):
"...Follow the white rabbit?"

[Sudden pause. Then the final line types:]

"KNOCK KNOCK, JIMBOB..."

CUT TO – Jimbob still Confused, still half asleep.

💥 SFX: SUDDEN, LOUD KNOCKING ON DOOR 💥 
Jimbob flinches, eyes wide.

JIMBOB:
"Who is it?"

LYKKE (calm, through door):
"Lykke."
-------------------------------
🟨 SCENE: APARTMENT DOOR – MOMENTS LATER
Jimbob cautiously opens the door. Standing outside is LYKKE THE NUN — robed in holy whites and silvers, with glowing crosses and somehow... bunny ears on her headpiece.

[camera cuts back and forth between showing lykke, maybe her enterage if she has one. and jimbob]

JIMBOB (deadpan):
"look, im not interested in buying any Girlguide cookies"

LYKKE (wry smile):
"It's spring. Even the Church of Lootius knows when to serve some... style."

JIMBOB:
"So… why are you here?"

LYKKE:
"You’ve been chosen, Jimbob. There’s an event tonight."

JIMBOB:
"Event? Like a sermon?"

LYKKE:
"Not quite. It's the Calypso Fashion Extravaganza."

JIMBOB:
"Sounds... different."

LYKKE:
"Lootius loves beauty. And you… look like you need some inspiration."

Lykke:
"You alright? Jimbob? you look alittle more confused than usual"

Jimbob: "My computer it... You ever have that feeling where your not sure if your awake or still playing a game?"

Lykke: "no...."
She doesn’t explain everything. She just tells him to come now. Adds mystery.

LYKKE:
"no....Come with me. There’s not much time. You’ll understand once you see the runway."

JIMBOB:
"You’re really not gonna tell me what this is about?"

LYKKE (smiling):
"No. But I will say this… your grind ends when you find your style."



lykke all of her dialogue in order:

"Lykke."
"It's spring. Even the Church of Lootius knows when to serve some... style."
"You’ve been chosen, Jimbob. There’s an event tonight."
"Not quite. It's the Calypso Fashion Extravaganza."
"Lootius loves beauty. And you… look like you need some inspiration."
"You alright? Jimbob? you look alittle more confused than usual"
"no...."
"Come with me. There’s not much time. You’ll understand once you see the runway."
"No. But I will say this… your grind ends when you find your style."

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
That was… unexpectedly impressive. You Colonists sure do know how to put on a show.

🧑‍🚀 Jimbob
Thanks. I’m just here recording it for my YouTube series, really. So uh… you’re from Hyperium, right?

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
That’s right. Richard Butte. I’m with Hyperium Enterprises. We usually work behind the scenes, but things are… changing.

🧑‍🚀 Jimbob
Changing how?


[Richard pauses, glancing up at the stars.]

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
If you havent noticed..A moon appeared outta nowhere. We call it ARIS. And it's waking up.

🧑‍🚀 Jimbob
That sounds bad.

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
It is. But it’s also full of opportunity — for people willing to get their hands dirty.

[He hands Jimbob a sleek chip or card.]

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
If you ever make your way to Aris, look me up at Hyperium HQ. We could use someone with your… instincts.

🧑‍🚀 Jimbob
My instincts mostly tell me to run away when robots are involved.

🧔‍♂️ Richard Butte
[chuckles] Then you’ll fit right in.

[Richard walks off, leaving Jimbob holding the chip. Fade to black.]

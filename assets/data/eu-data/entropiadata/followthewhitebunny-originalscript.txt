Jimbob cautiously opens the door. Standing outside is LYKKE THE NUN ‚Äî robed in holy whites and silvers, with glowing crosses and somehow... bunny ears on her headpiece.

[camera cuts back and forth between showing lykke, maybe her enterage if she has one. and jimbob]

JIMBOB (deadpan):
"look, im not interested in buying any Girlguide cookies"

LYKKE (wry smile):
"It's spring. Even the Church of Lootius knows when to serve some... style."

JIMBOB:
"So‚Ä¶ why are you here?"

LYKKE:
"You‚Äôve been chosen, Jimbob. There‚Äôs an event tonight."

JIMBOB:
"Event? Like a sermon?"

LYKKE:
"Not quite. It's the Calypso Fashion Extravaganza."

JIMBOB:
"Sounds... different."

LYKKE:
"Lootius loves beauty. And you‚Ä¶ look like you need some inspiration."

Lykke:
"You alright? Jimbob? you look alittle more confused than usual"

Jimbob: "My computer it... You ever have that feeling where your not sure if your awake or still playing a game?"

Lykke: "no...."
She doesn‚Äôt explain everything. She just tells him to come now. Adds mystery.

LYKKE:
"no....Come with me. There‚Äôs not much time. You‚Äôll understand once you see the runway."

JIMBOB:
"You‚Äôre really not gonna tell me what this is about?"

LYKKE (smiling):
"No. But I will say this‚Ä¶ your grind ends when you find your style."
